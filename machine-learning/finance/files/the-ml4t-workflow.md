# The ML4T Workflow – From Model To Strategy Backtesting
- How to backtest an ML-driven strategy
- Backtesting pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Getting the data right
- Look-ahead bias – use only point-in-time data
- Survivorship bias – track your historical universe
- Outlier control – do not exclude realistic extremes
- Sample period – try to represent relevant future scenarios
- Getting the simulation right
- Mark-to-market performance – track risks over time
- Transaction costs – assume a realistic trading environment
- Timing of decisions – properly sequence signals and trades
- Getting the statistics right
- The minimum backtest length and the deflated SR
- Optimal stopping for backtests
- How a backtesting engine works
- Vectorized versus event-driven backtesting
- Key implementation aspects
- Data ingestion – format, frequency, and timing
- Factor engineering – built-in factors versus libraries
- ML models, predictions, and signals
- Trading rules and execution
- Performance evaluation
- backtrader – a flexible tool for local backtests
